							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This app is a platform for surveys. During the semester, I found out that a lot of students upload survey links to kakaotalk, facebook, instagram, and etc. Many college students make google forms to get survey responses for their assignments and they make a promise that they would randomly pick some respondents for rewards, such as a coffee coupon. However, I found some problems behind this kind of survey process:
</p>
<li>1. It’s easy for college students to get responses of surveys targeting 20s - since they could share the survey through their SNS and friends. However, it is hard to get enough number of respondents other than 20s.
</li>
<li>2. Sometimes, people who made surveys ditch their responsibility — not giving out the reward they promised. However, there is no way one could check if the reward is given out or not unless he or she is randomly picked as a winner in a low probability.
</li>
<p> </p>
							<p>Therefore, I designed this survey platform app, which allows to get more responses from various people and to earn a reward!
